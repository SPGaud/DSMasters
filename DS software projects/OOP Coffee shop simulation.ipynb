    "## Customer Generation\n",
    "As the simulation is driven entirely by the actions of customers we need some code to generate them. The below task does something sneaky - it waits until the next customer arrives, adds that customer, then generates a new copy of the exact same task which then waits until the following customer arrives, and so on. It is the event equivalent of an infinite loop, and will create customers forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give the customers realistic arrival times a Poisson process is used. Mathematically this is quite fiddly, but the idea is simple: We assume all customers arrive independently, and that the average number of customers arriving during a time period can be represented by the area under a density graph. Given these assumptions their is only one solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The density graph was generated using the footfall data set for Micklegate in York, on Monday 2016-10-10 (Note that York is a northern city with Viking heritage - 'gate' in this context means 'road'). It was scaled by 0.05 on the assumption that 5% of people going past a coffee shop go in, and zeroed outside of 7am - 9pm to simulate opening hours. The end result is not unreasonable - you get a lunch surge, and the total customer count matches with that of a smaller independent coffee shop. There is also a slight surge around 3-4pm caused by a nearby school.\n",
