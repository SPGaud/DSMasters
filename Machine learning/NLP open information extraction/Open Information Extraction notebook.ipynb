    "# Open Information Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here will be implementing an *open information extraction* system, almost entirely from scratch. Information extraction takes a body of freeform text and extracts the contained information in a computer interpretable form. The word *open* simply means that the text/facts are arbitrary, so it will work with any input rather than a specific domain (e.g. legal texts).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, given the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Trolls really don't like the sun.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "you may extract the \"fact\":\n",
    "```\n",
    "('Trolls', 'do not like', 'the sun')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is based on the paper \"*Identifying Relations for Open Information Extraction*\", by Fader, Soderland & Etzioni.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of the system are as follows:\n",
    "*  Tokenise and split on sentences\n",
    "1. Part of speech tagging - token level\n",
    "2. Part of speech tagging - sentence level\n",
    "3. Named entity resolution\n",
    "4. Relation extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Summarise \"*20,000 leagues under the seas*\" by Jules Verne *(provided)*\n",

    "`ogonek.Tokenise()`\n",
    "\n",
    "A class that tokenises some text and splits it into sentences. Construct an instance with `tokens = ogonek.Tokenise('My text')`; it then has the same interface as a list of lists:\n",
    "* `len(tokens)`: Number of extracted sentences (not words)\n",
    "* `tokens[i]`: Sentence i, where i ranges from 0 to one less than `len(tokens)`. A sentence is a list of tokens.\n",

    "### Word vectors\n",
    "`ogonek.Glove()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing a `glove = ogonek.Glove()` object loads a heavily pruned Glove word vectors from the file `baby_glove.zip` into memory, and will then translate tokens into word vectors. Note that it automatically lowercases any token it is handed, so you don't need to. Has the following interface:\n",
    "* `glove.len_vec()` - Returns the length of the word vectors; should be 300.\n",
    "* `len(glove)` - Returns how many word vectors it knows of.\n",
    "* `token in glove` - Returns `True` if it has a word vector for that token, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "* `glove[token]` - Returns the word vector for the given token; raises an error if it does not have one.\n",
    "* `glove.decode(token)` - Returns the word vector for the given token, but if the word vector is unknown returns a vector of zeros instead (silent failure).\n",
    "* `glove.decodes(list of tokens)` - Returns a list of word vectors, one for each token. Has the same silent failure behaviour as `decode`.\n",

    "### Groningen Meaning Bank dataset\n",
    "`ogonek.GMB()`\n",

    "Provides access to the Groningen Meaning Bank dataset, which is supplied in the file `ner_dataset.csv`. Replicates the interface of the tokenisation system as far as it can. Construct with `gmb = ogonek.GMB()`; has the following interface:\n",
    "* `len(gmb)`: Number of sentences (not words) in data set\n",
    "* `gmb[i]`: Sentence i, where i ranges from 0 to one less than `len(gmb)`. A sentence is a list of tokens.\n",
    "* `gmb.pos(i)`: A list of POS tags that match with sentence i. Note that these are the full Penn Treebank tags (not the reduced set used below).\n",
    "* `gmb.ner(i)`: A list of named entities that match with sentence i. Using outside-inside scheme.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pretty printing\n",
    "\n",
    "`ogonek.aligned_print(*)` takes multiple lists and prints them out, aligning them so that all elements in position 0 of all lists are aligned vertically (extra space added as required), and then elements in position 1 and so on. For showing tags and a sentence with everything aligned. Also does word wrap and colour coding."
